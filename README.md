# My Neovim Configuration

My configuration for neovim.

This is originally forked from [nvim-starter](https://github.com/VonHeikemen/nvim-starter/tree/05-modular)'s `05-modular` branch

## Requirements

* Neovim v0.8 or greater.
* git.
* A `C` compiler. Can be `gcc`, `tcc` or `zig`.
* [make](https://www.gnu.org/software/make/), the build tool.
* (optional) [ripgrep](https://github.com/BurntSushi/ripgrep). Improves project wide search speed.
* (optional) [fd](https://github.com/sharkdp/fd). Improves file search speed.
* (optional) A patched font to display icons. I hear [nerdfonts](https://www.nerdfonts.com/) has a good collection.

## Installation

* Backup your existing configuration if you have one.

* If you don't know the path of the Neovim configuration folder use this command.

```sh
nvim --headless -c 'echo stdpath("config") | quit'
```

* Now clone this repository in that location.

```sh
git clone https://github.com/mertzt89/vim-files --branch lazy-migration <path from above>
```

> Do not execute this command as is. Replace `<path from above>` with the correct path from the previous step.

* Next time you start Neovim all plugins will be downloaded automatically. After this process is done `nvim-treesitter` will install language parsers for treesitter. And, `mason.nvim` will download language servers listed in the configuration. Use the command `:Mason` to check the download process of language servers.
